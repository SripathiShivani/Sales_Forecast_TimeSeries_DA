**📊 Sales Forecasting using Time Series Analysis**

**🎯 Project Goal**

The goal of this project is to forecast future sales using historical sales data and time series analysis techniques. 
By analyzing past trends and seasonal patterns, the model predicts future sales, helping businesses make informed decisions related to inventory management, resource allocation, and revenue planning.

**💡 Why This Project is Useful**

1. Helps businesses anticipate demand and avoid stockouts or overstocking.
2. Provides data-driven insights into sales patterns and seasonality.
3. Supports strategic planning in marketing, supply chain, and operations.
4. Demonstrates the practical application of time series models like ARIMA.

**🛠️ Tech Stack**

1. Programming Language: Python
2. Libraries Used:
 a)pandas – data manipulation
 b)numpy – numerical computations
 c)matplotlib & seaborn – data visualization
 d)statsmodels – ARIMA modeling for time series
3. Environment: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

**📂 Dataset**

The dataset contains historical sales records, including:
Date – daily sales timeline
Sales – numerical values to forecast
Category – product category breakdown
Region – geographical sales distribution


**🔎 Steps in the Project**

* Data Upload & Importing Libraries
* Data Cleaning – handle missing values, duplicates, and date parsing.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – visualize sales trends, seasonality, and summary stats.
* Modeling – apply ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) for forecasting.
* Prediction & Visualization – generate and plot future sales forecasts.
